# EEG-Based Driver Drowsiness Detection System

##  Overview

This repository contains the implementation of an **EEG-Based Cross-Subject Driver Drowsiness Recognition System** using an **Interpretable Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. The project leverages electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to detect driver drowsiness, aiming to enhance road safety by providing early warnings. The system is designed to be **calibration-free**, addressing the challenge of variability in EEG signals across different subjects and recording sessions.

##  Features

- **Data Preparation**: Utilizes a public EEG dataset collected from 27 subjects (aged 22â€“28) during a sustained-driving task in a virtual reality simulator. The dataset is pre-processed, down-sampled to 128 Hz, and includes 3-second samples with 30 channels Ã— 384 sample points.
- **Model**: Implements a novel interpretable CNN with separable convolutions for spatial-temporal processing of multi-channel EEG signals.
- **Interpretation**: Includes a visualization technique to explain model decisions, highlighting relevant EEG signal features like theta bursts and alpha spindles.
- **Evaluation**: Achieves a mean cross-subject accuracy of **79.35%** on balanced data and using **leave-one-subject-out (LOSO)** cross-validation.

## ðŸ“Š Usage

### ðŸ§  Training the Model:

**Run the training script**:
```bash
python Training.py
```

- Adjust hyperparameters (e.g., `batch_size=50`, `epochs=10`) inside the script if needed.

---

### Visualization:
